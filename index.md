# About this website

When somebody dies it can be hard to find information about their accounts, subscriptions, and their will. Not having that information makes it harder for the people managing the dead person's affairs.

This website is a place where you can register your account details so that a trusted person will know what to do. If you have a will, you can also register where it's stored, to make sure it doesn't get forgotten.

We'll ask you for the details of a trusted person, who will be able to see your saved information in the event of your death.

## Before you start

Every section is optional, so you don't have to share anything you don't want to.

We'll ask questions about:
- Your will
- Your bank accounts
- Savings
- Superannuation
- Stocks and shares
- Insurance
- Houses and real estate

The information you save will only be accessible by you and your trusted person.
